# Python Data Structures and Comprehensions Live Training

This is the local code for the *O'Reilly Live Training* - **Python Data Structures and Comprehensions** presented by Arianne Dee

If you want to use the web-hosted code, go to: [https://ariannedee.github.io/python-data-structs](https://ariannedee.github.io/python-data-structs/lab/index.html)

## For this class, you will need:
1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your computer
   - Installed from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
2. A copy of the **course files**
   - Cloned (ideal) or downloaded
3. Jupyter, NumPy and Pandas installed
    - `$ pip install jupyter numpy pandas`
4. Run the notebooks in Jupyter, PyCharm or VS Code (I'll be using PyCharm)
   - `$ jupyter-lab` or `$ jupyter notebook` if running in Jupyter
5. Fill out a short **survey**: https://forms.gle/KCSXZy7tHeb1B9ce8
   - We will analyze the results during the class.

There are detailed set up instructions for each step below.

If you have further questions, please email **arianne.dee.studios** at **gmail** dot **com**.

## Detailed setup instructions 

1. [Install Python](#1-install-python-37-or-higher)
2. [Download the code](#2-download-the-course-files)
3. [Install external packages](#3-install-external-python-packages)
4. [Run the notebooks](#4-run-the-notebooks)

### 1. Install Python 3.7 or higher

If you have been using Python for data science, 
you probably have it installed already through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

If not, or you're not sure, 
the easiest way to get Python is to download it from the 
[website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click the yellow button at the top to download the latest version of Python (e.g. 3.11.1)
3. Complete installation
   1. **On Mac or Linux**
      - Follow the prompts and install using the default settings.
   2. **On Windows**
      1. If you're just installing Python now,
      follow: [Windows Python installer instructions](docs/WININSTALL.md)
      2. If you've already installed Python with the default settings,
      follow: [Add Python to PATH variable in Windows](docs/WINSETPATH.md)

### 2. Download the course files

GitHub repository link: https://github.com/ariannedee/python-data-structures

#### If you know git:

Clone the repository.

`$ git clone https://github.com/ariannedee/python-data-structures.git`

#### If you don't know git:

1. Click the green "< > Code" button at the top-right of the page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip it and move the **python-data-structures-main** folder to a convenient location

### 3. Install external Python packages

**Jupyter**, **NumPy** and **Pandas** need to be installed.

In a terminal: `pip3 install jupyter numpy pandas`

### 4. Run the notebooks

VS Code and PyCharm (Unified) are Python IDEs that can run notebooks.

Or, to run in Jupyter, navigate to your cloned or downloaded code, then run:

- `$ jupyter-lab` to open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab in your browser; or
- `$ jupyter notebook` to open the classic Jupyter Notebook
